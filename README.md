## ✨ Overview

**Rule-Based Chatbot** is a console-based chatbot written by **Isomiddin**.

The project focuses on understanding how early chatbots and basic conversational systems work using:
- pattern matching
- rule-based decision logic
- text normalization
- fallback responses

This project serves as a **bridge between basic Python programming and AI / NLP concepts**.
